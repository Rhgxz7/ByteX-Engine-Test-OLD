ByteX is a general purpose, lightweight, data driven, multiplatform game engine writen in C++

# Information

ByteX will initially support 2d and 3d rendering through OpenGL and Vulkan APIs.
The engine will be initially developed in OpenGL and later ported to Vulkan and DirectX

*Why OpenGL support?*
Vulkan is the future of graphics, but right now it doesent support some older hardware. Beacuse of this the engine will
support OpenGL.

*Graphic APIs*
- OpenGL: 4.6 (Supported at early development state)
- Vulkan: 1.2 (Supported at early development state)
- DirectX: 11 (Supported at later development state)
- DirectX: 12 (Planned, not confirmed)
- Metal: (Support through moltenVK)
